## Gameplay
[Jingle](https://jingle.rs) is a GeoGuessr-inspired music guessing game for Oldschool RuneScape - the goal is to drop a pin on the map at the location where the current OSRS song is played in-game.

At the moment, there are two modes:

- Practice Mode (unlimited)
- Daily Jingle (a global daily challenge consisting of 5 songs)

The Daily Jingle resets at 00:00 in London, UK (GMT/BST)

## Development

I opened a [Discord](https://discord.gg/AR2FDmWggU) for suggestions/issues, as well as pull request guidance.
